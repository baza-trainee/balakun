      "I have friends from Ukraine, and other friends who have fled Ukraine, and I am very concerned about the war and helping people as they work through the transitions the war has forced on them. English is a difficult language, but it is a powerful tool that opens doors for many people. I want to help provide that. I hope to visit Ukraine after the victory and maybe teach English in a school there. I am learning Ukrainian slowly.",
